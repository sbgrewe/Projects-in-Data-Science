## Projects in Data Science

### Overview
This repository contains small ideas, projects, and implementations of code related to problems in data science. This repo will contain very elementary jobs, such as examples of loading files and creating simple histograms, but may eventually spiral out into multiple languages, including python, R, and SQL, and include projects spanning multiple months.

This is a live repository and may contain half-baked ideas, empty folders, and buggy code as projects are added, put aside, and updated over time.

The point of this repository is simply to create a living workspace to track my own progress over time while creating a home for these projects which shows off my own competence in the field.

### Contents
- Python_Packages contains examples of applications of python packages, such as numpy, pandas, polars, and ML packages, in the transformation and analysis of data.
- R contains markdown files which contain some worked examples of exercises and projects in R and should be reproducible with RStudio.
- Data_vis contains examples of applications of visuals, such as plots, dashboards, webpages, and animations, which communicate data. This will contain more sophisticated applications of python libraries, such as matplotlib, plotly, and seaborn.
