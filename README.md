### Projects in Data Science

This repository contains small ideas, projects, and implementations of code related to problems in data science. This repo will contain very elementary jobs, such as examples of loading files and creating simple histograms, but may eventually spiral out into multiple languages, including python, R, and SQL, and include projects spanning multiple months.

The point of this repository is to create a living workspace to track my own progress over time while creating a home for these projects which shows off my own competence in the field.
